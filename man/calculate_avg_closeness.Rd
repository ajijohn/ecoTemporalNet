\title{Calculate average time-dependent closeness centrality}
\usage{
calculate_avg_closeness(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object from `create_temporal_network()`}
}
\value{
A numeric value: average closeness centrality across all nodes
}
\description{
Computes the mean closeness centrality across all nodes in a co-flowering network.
Closeness centrality reflects how easily a species can reach (or be reached by) others
through overlapping flowering periods.
}
\details{
The function inverts edge weights (1/weight), treating stronger overlaps as shorter paths.
The graph is treated as undirected to reflect mutual co-flowering.
}
\section{Interpretation}{

\describe{
  \item{0}{Node is isolated — no access to other species}
  \item{Low}{Species is far from many others — few or weak overlaps}
  \item{High}{Species is close to many others — central in phenological timing}
}
}

\examples{
species_data <- data.frame(
  species = c("A", "B", "C"),
  start_day = c(1, 3, 6),
  end_day = c(5, 7, 9)
)
g <- create_temporal_network(species_data)
calculate_avg_closeness(g)
