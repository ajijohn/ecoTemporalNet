```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
# If you're developing locally:
# devtools::load_all(".")
library(ecoTemporalNet)    
library(igraph)
```

# 1. Define Species Data

```{r species-data}
species_data <- data.frame(
  species   = c("Species_A", "Species_B", "Species_C", "Species_D", "Species_E"),
  start_day = c(10, 40, 50, 60, 70),
  end_day   = c(50, 60, 70, 80, 100),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

knitr::kable(species_data, caption = "Flowering periods for each species")
```

# 2. Compute Temporal Overlaps

```{r overlap}
overlap <- check_temporal_overlap(species_data)
edges  <- overlap$edges
weights <- overlap$weights

knitr::kable(
  data.frame(
    from = edges[,1],
    to   = edges[,2],
    overlap_days = weights
  ),
  caption = "Directed edges and overlap durations"
)
```

# 3. Build the Network

```{r build-network}
g <- create_temporal_network(species_data)

# Inspect the graph
g
```

# 4. Visualize the Network

```{r plot-network, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
plot(
  g,
  vertex.label = V(g)$name,
  edge.width   = E(g)$weight / 5,  # scale widths for readability
  main         = "Temporal Ecological Network"
)
```

# 5. Next Steps

- You can convert this **igraph** object into a **networkDynamic** object if you need time‐slice animations or dynamic edge attributes (with the **networkDynamic** package).
- Extend `create_temporal_network()` to attach temporal windows to edges for dynamic simulations.
