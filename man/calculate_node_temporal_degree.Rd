\title{Calculate temporal degree of each node (species)}
\usage{
calculate_node_temporal_degree(g, mode = "total")
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object created with `create_temporal_network()`}

\item{mode}{Character. One of "total" (default), "in", or "out".
- "total": treats network as undirected (collapses direction)
- "in": counts incoming edges only (e.g., overlapping with species that flower later)
- "out": counts outgoing edges only (e.g., overlapping with species that flower earlier)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with:
  - species: node name
  - degree: number of connected overlapping edges
}
\description{
Computes the number of overlapping flowering partners per species in a phenological network.
In an undirected network, this corresponds to the total number of species a node co-flowers with.
In a directed network, in-degree and out-degree can reflect upstream/downstream relationships based on flowering order.
}
\section{Interpretation}{

\describe{
  \item{0}{Species does not coflower with any other species}
  \item{1–2}{Species overlaps with a few others during its phenophase}
  \item{High (>5)}{Species overlaps with many others — strong synchrony}
  \item{"in" vs "out"}{May indicate if a species tends to flower earlier or later relative to its neighbors}
}
}

\examples{
species_data <- data.frame(
  species = c("A", "B", "C"),
  start_day = c(1, 3, 6),
  end_day = c(5, 7, 9)
)
g <- create_temporal_network(species_data)
