\title{Calculate average time-dependent betweenness centrality}
\usage{
calculate_avg_betweenness(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object created using `create_temporal_network()`}
}
\value{
A numeric value: average betweenness centrality across all nodes in the (undirected) network
}
\description{
Computes the mean betweenness centrality across all nodes in a co-flowering network.
Betweenness centrality measures how often a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes,
indicating its role as a temporal bridge or connector between species that otherwise do not co-flower directly.
}
\details{
The function assumes that species with longer overlap (higher edge weight) are more strongly connected.
To prioritize such overlaps, the function inverts weights (i.e., 1/weight) for shortest path calculations.
}
\section{Interpretation}{

\describe{
  \item{0}{No node acts as a bridge — all paths are direct or disconnected}
  \item{Low (~0.1–0.5)}{Some species act as connectors between clusters, but many are peripheral}
  \item{High (>1)}{One or more species serve as important bridges — linking phenological modules or stages}
}
}

\examples{
species_data <- data.frame(
  species = c("A", "B", "C"),
  start_day = c(1, 3, 6),
  end_day = c(5, 7, 9)
)
g <- create_temporal_network(species_data)
calculate_avg_betweenness(g)
