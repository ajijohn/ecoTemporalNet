\title{Calculate upstream and downstream reachability sets for each node}
\usage{
calculate_temporal_reachability(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{A directed igraph object from `create_temporal_network()`, with time-respecting edge direction}
}
\value{
A data.frame with species name, upstream size, and downstream size
}
\description{
For each species (node), computes the number of other species it can reach
(downstream set) and the number of species that can reach it (upstream set)
via time-respecting paths in a directed co-flowering network.
}
\examples{
species_data <- data.frame(
  species = c("A", "B", "C"),
  start_day = c(1, 3, 6),
  end_day = c(5, 7, 9)
)
g <- create_temporal_network(species_data)  # assuming edge direction is time-respecting
calculate_temporal_reachability(g)
